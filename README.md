# Programming Ruby 1.9 #

I'm reading [Programming Ruby 1.9](http://pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9) by Dave Thomas, Chad Fowler & Andy Hunt. 

This repository contains the code I write as I go along. When I finish the book, I'll post a book review to [my blog](http://matthewblair.net). The plan is to read at least 2 chapters a day.
